# Latent Space Pathfinding (Experimental)

This folder contains minimal working code for testing our current idea:  
**learning to navigate the latent space using the gradient of an auxilliary regressor neural network.**

The setup is focused on experimenting with the idea of _path-finding in latent space_ guided by another model (e.g., a volume regressor or genus classifier). We're exploring whether such guidance can help interpolate or transition meaningfully between latent codes.

## Core Components

- `model.py`: The architecture code for the neural regressor from latent vectors to volume/genus
- `config.py`: Customizable hyperparameters and config stuff
- `dataset.py`: Dataset class
- `train.py`: Simple training pipeline with checkpoint saving
- `compute_volume_genus.py`: utility functions for generating latent->volume data
- `sdfs.py`: several different (analytical) sdfs along with an interpolator class
- `data/`: Synthetic data generated by running `compute_volume.py`'s `generate_syn_latent_volume_data()`
- `checkpoints/`: The best model weights saved after training the volume and genus regressor
- `trained_deepsdfs/`: Trained deepsdf models
- `data/`: Training data generated for the auxilliary regression model
- `train.py`: Training script for genus/volume regressor
- `compute_path.py`, `compute_path_opt.py`, `compute_path_geodesic.py` each include different path-finding algorithms with their own pros and cons
- `visualize.py`: utility functions for data and path visualization

## Workflow
1. Copy your trained DeepSDF checkpoint into `trained_deepsdfs/`
2. Set the path in `compute_volume_genus.py` and run the script to generate the training data for the auxilliary regressors (volume and genus)
3. Select the genera/volume dataset in the script and run it to train your regressor
4. Set your model paths in `visualize.py` and define your start and end points of the latent path you wish to optimize 

NOTE: Set your training and visualization parameters in `config.py`
